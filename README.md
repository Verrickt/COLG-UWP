# COLG-UWP

## Introduction

Unofficial UWP client for [Colg](http://bbs.colg.cn) forum.



 As a WindowsPhone User , my initial purpose is to offer a smooth browsering experience for WindowsPhone users. Since being a Microsofft fanboy , I'd like to targeting the UWP platform that Microsoft intruduced  for Windows 10 , for a much larger potential user base. While ,  maybe you will be wondering why not just use the browser ,that's because the current browsers don't provide a consistent experience across a variety of Windows devices.


For example , Chrome may be a good choice for PC user ,but it's not good for tablet users cause it consumes too much battery . As for mobile ,Chrome is even not available to WindowsPhones . F**k off,Google.

Another example. Edge is good for mobile devices for it's battery friendliness. But on tablet and PC it's not as stable as it's on mobile. Believe me ,you won't want to remember url for 20+ tabs and manually open them after Edge crushes. F**k off MS.

For the same reason, it's safe to assume that no browser offers a consistent experience across Windows devices. And that's why this app is here.

Colg do have client for Android and iOS but as for now(2017/3/22) it seems both of their development has stop for half a year. I see this as a opportunity to catch up with them and I've set my ultimate goal for this app : offer the same functionality as the Android version.

Currently it's still under feature development and you can try it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/colg/9nblggh1xxb5)
